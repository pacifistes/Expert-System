Start of resolution:

I search the value of the fact D:
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact D
I check the rule A+B+C => D
I search the value of the fact A:
There are no rules but the fact A is initialize to true
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact A
I search the value of the fact B:
There are no rules but the fact B is initialize to true
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact B
I search the value of the fact C:
There are no rules but the fact C is initialize to true
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact C
The condition of the rule A+B+C => D is valid, so I apply the conclusion
The fact D is set to true
I look if the realized change activates new rules for the fact D
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact D
I look if the realized change activates new rules for the fact A
There are no rules but the fact A is initialize to true
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact A
I look if the realized change activates new rules for the fact B
There are no rules but the fact B is initialize to true
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact B
I look if the realized change activates new rules for the fact C
There are no rules but the fact C is initialize to true
I am looking for all the rules whose conditions are not yet valid for the fact C
D
The fact D is true
